      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This service has been recently renamed to Traffic Routing. Don&amp;rsquo;t be confused, article still applies to it‚&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to tell you about very new service in the Microsoft Azure family called Azure Websites Testing in Production (or just TiP). It hasÂ not been publicly announced yet but it&amp;#8217;sÂ already available toÂ play with. This service will help you manage and test your website deployments more reliably. Also you can implementÂ A/BÂ testing with it. So before we start I&amp;#8217;d like to say some words about what it is and why you might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-b-testing&#34;&gt;A/B testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we think about the name itself then we can suggest that &lt;a title=&#34;A/B testing&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A/B testing&lt;/a&gt; is about testing A against of B. And that&amp;#8217;s 100% correct. This is also called split-testing or testing in production. It helps you analyze users&amp;#8217; behavior based on some variable parameters or features. Imagine you want to implement something completely new for your website. Let&amp;#8217;s say &amp;#8212; change background color from red to blue. How would you then know that people like that? What ifÂ new color will annoy your visitors and they will convert less (by conversion you may consider everything &amp;#8212; payment, ads click, subscription etc)? To prevent yourself from assumptions based on your only feelings (which unfortunately might be wrong) you can run some A/B tests against your hypothesis. This means thatÂ you have two deployments running in parallel: one of them has old design and functionality (base) and the second has new features deployed (variant). Then if you split your incoming traffic 50/50Â and monitor users&amp;#8217; behavior you will be able toÂ make you decisions based on statistics and real data. IfÂ variant converts better than make it your new base and direct 100% traffic there. But if not then keep base and think about new features to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
